<h4>   I created this website when I was in this dormitory and saw people doing their administrative work there with paper and in a traditional way. I asked the dorm manager to allow me to create this app for free, and the manager agreed. After 45 days, when I created the app, it was not accepted, but still, this app showed my enthusiasm for coding. This project is valuable to me.</h4>
